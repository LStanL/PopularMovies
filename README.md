## Project overview
Build an app to display list of popular movies, which can be sorted by most popular and top rated.

1. Upon launch, present the user with an grid arrangement of movie posters.
2. Allow your user to change sort order via a setting:
  * The sort order can be by most popular, or by top rated
3. Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as:
  * original title
  * movie poster image thumbnail
  * a plot synopsis (called overview in the api)
  * user rating (called vote_average in the api)
  * release date
